# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
## Purpose of the Project

In this project, as requested by Seth and Tom we helped determine the total number of votes, get a list of candidates who received votes, calculate the total number of votes each candidates received, calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won and determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

We created a list containing certain variables and a dictionary containing the canditates, county and voters. We implemented for loop and if statements to save all our election results to a text file and using f-strings for proper arrangements.

## Resources and Tools
- Software: Python 3.9.7, Visual Studio Code 1.38.1
- Data source: election_results.csv

## Election-Audit Summary
After proper analysis of our data-set and then running the script, we have deducted a proper breakdown of the election results. We have the results of voting for each candidate and their respective county. We will thereby analyse this result to determine the correlation between each candidates, county and the outcome of votes.

The following recommendations can be made to provide better results in the future:
- Use If statements to determine each candiate's performance in each county inorder to determine the reason behind such performance maybe it's as a result of them having more voters in that county.
